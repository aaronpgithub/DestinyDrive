Time Shifter Clock boss
On transition, pause bullets every five seconds and add new stuff

Snow level: Small snowball enemies that just shoot filler slow bullets

To get true final boss, you must select items at the end of levels that have an evil electricity around them
After selecting, fight three 1 minute bosses, you fight one boss after each item picked up and after three items
you unlock the final boss
(Kinda cool, but players may not want to go to true final boss and not want to fight small bosses)

Dyna Mike : Reload weapons, to reload you must stand in place and mash active button
			In return, weapons are usually strong and slow

The small little blaster guys in City should have jets, so they should have jet blast particles under them
