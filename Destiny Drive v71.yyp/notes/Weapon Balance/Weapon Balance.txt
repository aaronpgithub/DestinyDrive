DPS - Damage per second
RPS - Rounds per second
RPM - Rounds per minute

PISTOL
	-supposed to be balanced with average speed, damage, and accuracy.
	-damage should make it feel like you kill at an average speed.
	-A fast shot speed to feel like its a real gun.
	-Average accuracy that doesn't really get in the way of hitting enemies.
	-The pistol damage should be what all other guns are based on.
	
DAMAGE = 5
FIRE RATE = 10 frames (6 BPS/360 RPM) - 30 DPS
SHOT SPEED = 6
ACCURACY = 4

SMG
	-Supposed to be faster than the pistol.
	-Less damage in turn for better firerate.
	-Less accuracy than the pistol.
	-Slightly faster shot speed than the pistol.
	
DAMAGE = 4
FIRE RATE = 7 frames (8 BPS/480 RPM) - 32 DPS
SHOT SPEED = 7
ACCURACY = 6

REVOLVER
	-Supposed to be slower but more damaging than the pistol.
	-Higher damage in turn for slower firerate.
	-Slightly more accuracy than the pistol.
	-Same shot speed as the pistol.
	
DAMAGE = 8
FIRE RATE = 15 frames (4 BPS/240 RPM) - 32 DPS
SHOT SPEED = 6
ACCURACY = 2


Pistol - Average Stats

Swamp - Both weapons have same DPS
Revolver - High damage, low firerate
SMG - High firerate, low damage

Forest - Now there is some change in DPS
Hand Eagle - Slow firerate that can be made faster if you semi auto fire
Rifle - High damage, low firerate
Tommy - High firerate, low damage, low accuracy
Twin - Shoot bullets at angles

	-Hand Eagle - Lowest DPS at normal fire, high DPS at max fire
		DAMAGE = 5.625
		FIRE RATE = 18-7 frames (3-8 BPS/180-480 RPM) - 16.8-45 DPS
		SHOT SPEED = 7
		ACCURACY = 4
	
	-Rifle - Middle DPS of the bunch, but most accurate and reliable
		DAMAGE = 11.6
		FIRE RATE = 18 frames (3 BPS/180 RPM) - 35 DPS
		SHOT SPEED = 8
		ACCURACY = 1
		
	-Tommy - More DPS than Rifle, but innacuraccy makes it less reliable
		DAMAGE = 2
		FIRE RATE = 3 frames (20 BPS/1200 RPM) - 40 DPS
		SHOT SPEED = 7
		ACCURACY = 9
			
	-Twin - If both bullets hit same enemy, more than Tommy DPS, but bullets do half damage
		DAMAGE = 7.5
		FIRE RATE = 10 frames (6 BPS/360 RPM) - 45 DPS
		SHOT SPEED = 7
		ACCURACY = 1 (plus 10 degree offset)

Volcano
M17 - High damage if you click fast enough
Burst - Middle of the bunch but accurate and reliable
Hunting Rifle - Highest damage per shot, but slow firerate so it's at the middle/high?
Wave Gun - High DPS against single targets, but innacurate and is made for just killing everything at a slow rate
Akimbo Pistols - Kinda like the M17 of the 'fast' weapon branch
Triple - Like wavegun for killing multiple things at once, but a bit more damage for less crowd control
