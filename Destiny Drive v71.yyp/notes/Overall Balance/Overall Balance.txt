Make Swamp and Wasteland easier, I think

Bosses and minibosses are difficult and don't leave as much room for difficulty expansion as id like

Enemies need less HP and be a bit more attackish, maybe
	-definitely lower HP though, lower the time it takes to beat a level
	-To combat having lower HP, need to make it where they hve a chance to attack
