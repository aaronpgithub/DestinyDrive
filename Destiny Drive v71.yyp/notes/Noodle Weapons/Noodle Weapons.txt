Pip is the baseline for damage, and Pip gains an average of 20% more damage per wave
Noodle on the first level does 50% of Pips damage
	Impressionable boosts will give about a 5% increase, making it where you can deal a max of 150% more damage by the end of the game, 50% more than Pip

Start with rusty pistol, shoots a bit slower, worse firerate, short range
	Six columns with 5 choices
	Maybe just 30 random items that make weapons different (dont like this)
	
Shoot two bullets that go side by side 20/20 style, a bit less damage (both together makes 110% damage?)
Weapon is now a burst weapon
Charge up damage
Accuracy increase (make accuracy pretty bad so this is worth it)
Damage increase, shorter range
Range increase, faster shot speed
Firerate up
Homing bullets, firerate up
