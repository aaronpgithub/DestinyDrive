Congrats! You got it kinda working...


1. Make moving decals a loop, you can slightly tell when they reset
2. Make everything have specific scripts so you can make new decorations easier
3. TRY to make it where each sprite can have slightly specific changes, like image index and y position.

make the transitions come in WAAAAY quicker...
the far background is backing up all the other transitions...

need to make it where the far background changes to the transition quicker
to do this, make the looping movement
if its transitioning time, and the third decal isn't on the screen, add enough so the third is on the screen.
	-next, make sure its in the same position (and later when you have randomized far backgrounds, make sure its the same image_index)
	-then, transition time will be quicker
